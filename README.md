# Google Foobar Challenge
I recently heard about Google's [foobar challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/), which is an invitation-only coding test platform of Google. The exact criteria of invitation is unknown (to me), but I think there are certain programming-related search terms that could trigger the invitation. I tried some of those proven working methods, including `c++ move semantics`, `mutex lock`, `python list comprehension`, `python try except`, `arraylist java` and `angularjs directive`, but nothing seemed to work out for me. I quickly gave up and created this repository so that I could just search and solve those problems, but I got an invitation soon after I solved one problem. If you want to know about the invitation criteria, [here](#environments) are the circumstances that caused the invitation for me.

## Levels
There are 5 levels and each level gives you a different number of challenges (which are randomly selected from a question bank), time limits, and perks when you finished the level. In order to progress to the next level, you need to submit solution(s) for every challenge it throws at you, and your solution must pass the blind unit tester provided by Google.
|      Level      | # of Challenges | Time to Solve / C |              Perk              |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------------------------: |
|     Level 1     |        1        |     168 hours     |              None              |
|     Level 2     |        2        |     168 hours     | 1 x single-use invitation code |
|     Level 3     |        3        |     168 hours     |      Google recruit survey     |
|     Level 4     |        2        |     360 hours     | 2 x single-use invitation code |
|     Level 5     |        1        |     528 hours     |                                |

## Environments
Initially, I thought the invitation only appears to someone who uses Chrome and/or logged into their Google accounts, because I didn't get the invitation when I tried those search terms without signing into my accounts, even though I did it on many browsers<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> and platforms<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> (1-2 times each). But [Invitation #B1](#invitation-b1-july-11-2021) changed everything. You *can* sign into your Google accounts on Level 1, and you're *required* to sign in for Level 2 problems, but no Google account (or specific browsers, etc) is required to get an invitation.

### Invitation #A1: July 10, 2021
* **Search terms**: `headless chrome`
* **The exact behavior that triggers the invitation**: 
  * Search the term above -> Click the first result -> Go back to search result -> Go to page 2 -> Go to page 3 -> Scroll up and down and wait a little;
  * then **the invitation popped up**, that reads;
    * <span style="background-color: black">`Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?`</span> <span style="background-color: #35BDB8">`I want to play`</span> <span style="background-color: #F48020">`No thanks`</span> <span style="background-color: #EC1B52">`Don't show me this again`</span>
    * (FYI, there are other variants, like <span style="background-color: black">`You're speaking our language. Up for a challange?`</span> <span style="background-color: #35BDB8">`I want to play`</span> <span style="background-color: #F48020">`No thanks`</span> <span style="background-color: #EC1B52">`Don't show me this again`</span>)

### Invitation #A2: July 11, 2021
* **Exact behavior**: Search the term above -> Click the first result -> Go back to **the search result tab** -> Go to page 2 -> Go to page 3 -> Scroll up and down and wait a little

### Invitation #A3: July 11, 2021
* **Exact behavior**: Search the term above -> Click the first result -> Go back to search result -> Go to page 2 -> Go to page 3 -> Go to page 4 -> Go to page 5

### Invitation #A4: July 11, 2021
* **Exact behavior**: Search the term above -> Click the first result -> Go back to search result -> Go to page 2 -> Go to page 3 -> Go to page 4 (by clicking the next, not number)

### Invitation #A5: August 29, 2021
* **Exact behavior**: Search the term above -> Wait a few sec and it pops right up

### Invitation #B1: July 11, 2021
* **Search terms**: `python list comprehension`
* **Exact behavior**: (After a few failed attempts on `headless chrome` and `c++ move semantics`) Search `headless chrome` -> Invitation started to pop up after I clicked one of the result already -> Went back to search result page but no invitation -> Search `python list comprehension`

### Invitation #C1: July 12, 2021
* **Search terms**: `python try except`
* **Exact behavior**: (After a few failed attempts on `python list comprehension` and `c++ move semantics`) Search `python try except` -> Go to page 2 -> Go to page 3 -> Go to page 4
